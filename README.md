## Why Positioner?

Has it ever happened in your life, that you finally put your legion of desktop icons onto their positions, sorted them by meaning/color, **BUT** at the next start, Windows treacherously mixed your icons with quantum wind?

It happened to me. This was the initial reason for the development.

`Positioner` - will help not only restore the same layout, but also create several `snapshots` of the desktop, with your settings, and switch between them.

    ‚ú® Features

> ‚ö† Positioner is now at the alpha-stage, so exist some nuances.<br>
> For example, the next few releases will work in single-threaded mode, in order<br>to facilitate testing (that is, when executing a command, the GUI will freeze)

* Save/restore icons position

  <img height="200" width="500" align="center" src="https://github.com/s0d3s/Positioner/blob/media_storage/distribution/main/exmp_save_restore.gif"/>
  
* Attach `snapshots` to quick slots

  <img height="200" width="500" align="center" src="https://github.com/s0d3s/Positioner/blob/media_storage/distribution/main/exmp_attach_to_slot.gif"/>
  
* Change desktop view(`flags`)

  <img height="200" width="500" align="center" src="https://github.com/s0d3s/Positioner/blob/media_storage/distribution/main/exmp_desktop_flags.gif"/>
  
* Quick button for hide\show icons

  <img height="200" width="500" align="center" src="https://github.com/s0d3s/Positioner/blob/media_storage/distribution/main/exmp_hide_show.gif"/>
  
* Restore icons position on OS startup

* Set custom `snapshot` name
  
* Create & use your own transition(the logic by which the icons move from point to point)
  > Now this feature is available, but only in manual mode (it is not displayed in the GUI).<br>
  > To create your own transition, modify the file `src/movement_transitions/default_transition.py`.<br>
  > You can do this before "compiling" or after installation.

## üíΩ Installation

You can use `Positioner` in two ways:
 - Install and use as a standalone programm
 - Download source code, install dependencies and run as python script

> ‚ùó NOTE:
>   If you have too many icons on your desktop, then the transition may not be smooth.<br>
>   This is a Windows bug (which cannot be bypassed at the Positioner level), however,<br>
>   this process can be facilitated by turning off the flag responsible for displaying file names.
